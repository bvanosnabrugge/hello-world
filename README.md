My Baby

Did I show you yet, a picture of my baby?
No?
Here, a picture! A picture! A figure!
Here its processing its first (its first) time steps!
Here you see it making its first steps!
Is anything more wonderful?
Here, the poor child, is throwing errors
Is it not adorable?
Doesnt it do this adorably?
Dont you think it is so cute?
Only Yesterday it made its first appearance on a conference.
Such a great model, just like its modeller.
Such a great toddler, just like its modeller
Somebody said we should train it better,
but I think it is just perfect as it is.
It is after all such a great model.

Of course, some times are hard.
The errors, the little accidents, the long and broken nights.

Sigh.

But, enough about my model.
Do you have any plans to start making models?
